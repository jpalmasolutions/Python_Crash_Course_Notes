### High-Level Progamming Languages

Python is what you call a high-level programming language. The intent of High-Level programming languages is to facilitate the creation of instructions/commands for a computer to run. What is `high-level` about these languages is that they do not require you to know the actual language that a computer needs to run its commands. Languages that a computer understands are called low-level languages. A translation process takes care of going from high-level to low-level.

A few High-Level Programming Languages:
- Java
- Python
- C++
- C

### Low-Level Programming Languages

Ultimately, a computer cannot read python commands and run them without first converting those commands into executable binary instructions.

A computer is a computational machine, not a magic box. I always say, computers are dumb, and they cannot do anything that we do not tell it to do. A computer needs instructions to run, and we are in an era where they do it so fast that it looks like magic. What it does at the end of it all is compute mathematical operations at an incredibly fast rate.

#### How do you get from human-readable instructions to computer-executable instructions? 

High-Level (Human Readable) -> Translation -> Low-Level (Computer Readable)

Machine Language is a list of binary numbers that can be understood by the computer to execute different mathematical operations and store the binary outcomes in physical locations within the computer.

I use the term computer very loosely, but it is actually the Central Processing Unit (CPU) that takes care of executing instructions:

Computers nowadays are executing billions of instructions per second.

Apples M2 chip is blowing it out of the water. `The M2 can process up to 15.8 trillion operations per second â€” over 40 percent more than the M1.`
